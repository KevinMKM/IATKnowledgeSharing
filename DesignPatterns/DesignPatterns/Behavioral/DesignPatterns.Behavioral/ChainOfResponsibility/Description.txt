Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern
The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests along a chain of handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Key Idea
Decouple the sender of a request from its receivers by allowing multiple objects to handle the request.

Each handler in the chain has the opportunity to process the request or pass it to the next handler.

Promote flexibility and extensibility in handling requests.

When to Use the Chain of Responsibility Pattern
When you want to decouple the sender of a request from its receivers.

For example, handling different types of requests in a flexible way.

When you want to give multiple objects a chance to handle a request.

For example, processing an event in a pipeline of handlers.

When you want to dynamically specify the order of handlers.

The chain can be modified at runtime to add, remove, or reorder handlers.

Example Without Chain of Responsibility
Imagine you're building a logging system that processes log messages based on their severity (e.g., Info, Warning, Error). Without the Chain of Responsibility pattern, you might use conditional logic to handle each type of log message:

Problems with This Approach
Tight Coupling:

The Logger class is tightly coupled to the specific types of log messages and their handling logic.

Violates Open/Closed Principle:

Adding a new severity level (e.g., Debug) requires modifying the Logger class.

Inflexibility:

The handling logic is hardcoded, making it difficult to change or extend.

With Chain of Responsibility

Key Differences and Benefits
Decoupling:

The sender of the request (client) is decoupled from the receivers (handlers).

Flexibility:

You can easily add, remove, or reorder handlers in the chain.

Open/Closed Principle:

You can add new handlers without modifying existing code.

Single Responsibility Principle:

Each handler is responsible for a specific type of request.

Summary
Without Chain of Responsibility: Tight coupling, violation of the Open/Closed Principle, and inflexibility in handling requests.

With Chain of Responsibility: Decoupling, flexibility, adherence to the Open/Closed Principle, and single responsibility for each handler.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to process requests in a flexible and extensible way, such as handling log messages, processing events, or managing workflows. It promotes loose coupling, flexibility, and maintainability.
