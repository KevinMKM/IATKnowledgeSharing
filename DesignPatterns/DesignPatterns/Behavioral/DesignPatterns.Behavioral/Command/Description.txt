Command Design Pattern
The Command is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Key Idea
Encapsulate a request as an object, separating the request's execution from the object that invokes it.

Promote loose coupling between the sender (invoker) and the receiver (executor) of the request.

Support features like queuing, logging, and undo/redo operations.

When to Use the Command Pattern
When you want to parameterize objects with operations.

For example, creating a menu system where each menu item executes a different command.

When you want to queue, log, or undo operations.

For example, implementing an undo/redo feature in a text editor.

When you want to decouple the sender of a request from its receiver.

The sender doesn't need to know how the request is executed or who executes it.

Example Without Command
Imagine you're building a simple remote control for a light. Without the Command pattern, you might directly call the light's methods:

Problems with This Approach
Tight Coupling:

The client code is tightly coupled to the Light class and its methods.

No Flexibility:

You cannot easily add new commands (e.g., dim the light) or change the behavior of existing commands.

No Support for Advanced Features:

You cannot queue, log, or undo operations.

With Command

Key Differences and Benefits
Decoupling:

The RemoteControl (invoker) is decoupled from the Light (receiver).

Flexibility:

You can easily add new commands (e.g., dim the light) or change the behavior of existing commands.

Support for Advanced Features:

You can queue, log, or undo operations by extending the ICommand interface.

Summary
Without Command: Tight coupling, lack of flexibility, and no support for advanced features like undo/redo.

With Command: Decoupling, flexibility, and support for advanced features like queuing, logging, and undo/redo.

The Command pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to encapsulate requests as objects, such as implementing menu systems, remote controls, or undo/redo functionality. It promotes loose coupling, flexibility, and extensibility.
