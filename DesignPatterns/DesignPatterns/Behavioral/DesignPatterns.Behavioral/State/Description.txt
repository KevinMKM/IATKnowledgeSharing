State Design Pattern
The State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes. It encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes and delegates the behavior to the current state object.

Key Idea
Encapsulate state-specific behavior into separate state classes.

Delegate behavior to the current state object.

Allow the object to change its behavior dynamically by switching state objects.

When to Use the State Pattern
When an object's behavior depends on its state and it needs to change its behavior at runtime.

For example, a vending machine that behaves differently depending on whether it has items in stock or is out of stock.

When you have a lot of conditional statements that depend on the object's state.

The State pattern replaces these conditionals with state-specific classes.

When you want to make the state transitions explicit and manageable.

Each state class can define the transitions to other states.

Example Without State
Imagine you're building a vending machine that sells drinks. Without the State pattern, you might use conditional logic to handle the machine's behavior based on its state:

Problems with This Approach
Complex Conditional Logic:

The VendingMachine class is cluttered with conditional statements that depend on the state.

Violates Open/Closed Principle:

Adding a new state (e.g., maintenance mode) requires modifying the VendingMachine class.

Hard to Maintain:

The code becomes harder to read and maintain as the number of states and transitions grows.

With State

Key Differences and Benefits
Simplified Logic:

Each state class encapsulates the behavior for a specific state, eliminating complex conditional logic.

Open/Closed Principle:

You can add new states without modifying the VendingMachine class.

Maintainability:

The code is easier to read, maintain, and extend.

Summary
Without State: Complex conditional logic, violation of the Open/Closed Principle, and hard-to-maintain code.

With State: Simplified logic, adherence to the Open/Closed Principle, and improved maintainability.

The State pattern is ideal for scenarios where an object's behavior depends on its state, such as vending machines, game characters, or workflow systems. It promotes flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.
