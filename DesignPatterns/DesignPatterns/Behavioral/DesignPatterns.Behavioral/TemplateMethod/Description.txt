Template Method Design Pattern
The Template Method is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

Key Idea
Define the structure of an algorithm in a base class (the template method).

Allow subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure.

Promote code reuse and consistency in algorithm implementation.

When to Use the Template Method Pattern
When you want to enforce a common algorithm structure across multiple subclasses.

For example, a data processing pipeline with fixed steps but customizable implementations.

When you want to avoid code duplication by sharing common behavior in a base class.

The template method encapsulates the common logic.

When you want to allow subclasses to customize specific steps of an algorithm.

Subclasses can override the "hook" methods to provide their own implementations.

Example Without Template Method
Imagine you're building a system for generating reports. Without the Template Method pattern, you might duplicate the report generation logic in each report type:

Problems with This Approach
Code Duplication:

The common steps (e.g., fetching data) are duplicated across report types.

Violates DRY Principle:

The "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle is violated, making the code harder to maintain.

Inflexibility:

Adding a new report type requires duplicating the common logic again.

With Template Method

Key Differences and Benefits
Code Reuse:

The common steps (e.g., fetching data) are shared in the base class, eliminating duplication.

Consistency:

The overall structure of the algorithm is enforced by the template method.

Flexibility:

Subclasses can customize specific steps (e.g., formatting and generating output) without changing the algorithm's structure.

Summary
Without Template Method: Code duplication, violation of the DRY principle, and inflexibility.

With Template Method: Code reuse, consistency, and flexibility by encapsulating the algorithm's structure in a base class.

The Template Method pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to enforce a common algorithm structure while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps, such as report generation, data processing pipelines, or workflow systems. It promotes code reuse, consistency, and maintainability.
