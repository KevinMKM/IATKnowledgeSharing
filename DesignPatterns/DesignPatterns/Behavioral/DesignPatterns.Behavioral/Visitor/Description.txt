Visitor Design Pattern
The Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations to a set of objects without modifying their classes. It separates the algorithm from the object structure by moving the operations into a separate visitor class.

Key Idea
Define a visitor interface with a method for each type of object in the structure.

Each object in the structure accepts a visitor and calls the appropriate method.

Promote extensibility by allowing new operations to be added without modifying the object structure.

When to Use the Visitor Pattern
When you want to add new operations to a set of objects without modifying their classes.

For example, adding export functionality to a document structure.

When the object structure is stable but you need to frequently add new operations.

The Visitor pattern allows you to add new operations without changing the object structure.

When you want to separate the algorithm from the object structure.

The visitor encapsulates the algorithm, making it easier to manage and extend.

Example Without Visitor
Imagine you're building a document editor that supports different types of elements (e.g., text, images). Without the Visitor pattern, you might add export functionality directly to each element class:

Problems with This Approach
Violates Open/Closed Principle:

Adding a new export format (e.g., PDF) requires modifying each element class.

Tight Coupling:

The export logic is tightly coupled to the element classes.

Code Duplication:

The export logic is duplicated across element classes.

With Visitor
Now, let's refactor the above example using the Visitor pattern.

Key Differences and Benefits
Open/Closed Principle:

You can add new export formats (e.g., PDF) without modifying the element classes.

Separation of Concerns:

The export logic is encapsulated in visitor classes, separating it from the element classes.

Extensibility:

New operations can be added by creating new visitor classes.

Summary
Without Visitor: Violation of the Open/Closed Principle, tight coupling, and code duplication.

With Visitor: Adherence to the Open/Closed Principle, separation of concerns, and extensibility.

The Visitor pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to add new operations to a set of objects without modifying their classes, such as exporting documents, processing abstract syntax trees, or performing operations on complex data structures. It promotes flexibility, maintainability, and e
