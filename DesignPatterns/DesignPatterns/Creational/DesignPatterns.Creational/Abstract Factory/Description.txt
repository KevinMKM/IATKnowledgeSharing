Abstract Factory Design Pattern
The Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It is an extension of the Factory Method pattern, but instead of creating a single object, it creates a family of objects.

Key Idea
Define an interface for creating families of related objects.

Encapsulate the creation of multiple related objects in a single factory.

Promote consistency among the created objects.

When to Use the Abstract Factory Pattern
When a system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

When a system needs to work with multiple families of related objects.

For example, a UI library might need to create buttons, text boxes, and menus that are consistent with a specific theme (e.g., Windows or macOS).

When you want to enforce consistency among the created objects.

For example, you don't want to mix objects from different families (e.g., a Windows button with a macOS text box).

Example Without Abstract Factory
Imagine you're building a UI library that supports two themes: Windows and macOS. Without the Abstract Factory pattern, you might directly instantiate objects.

Problems with This Approach
Tight Coupling: The client code is tightly coupled to the concrete classes (WindowsButton, WindowsTextBox, etc.).

Violates Open/Closed Principle: Adding a new theme (e.g., Linux) requires modifying the client code.

Inconsistency Risk: It's easy to accidentally mix objects from different themes (e.g., a Windows button with a macOS text box).

With Abstract Factory

Key Differences and Benefits
Loose Coupling:

The client code depends on the abstract interfaces (IButton, ITextBox, and IUIFactory), not on concrete implementations.

Consistency:

The factory ensures that all created objects belong to the same family (e.g., all Windows or all macOS).

Extensibility:

To add a new theme (e.g., Linux), you only need to:

Create new concrete products (e.g., LinuxButton, LinuxTextBox).

Create a new concrete factory (e.g., LinuxUIFactory).

No changes are required in the client code.

Summary
Without Abstract Factory: Direct instantiation leads to tight coupling, inconsistency, and difficulty in extending the system.

With Abstract Factory: Object creation is delegated to factories, promoting loose coupling, consistency, and extensibility.

The Abstract Factory pattern is ideal for systems that need to create families of related objects while ensuring consistency and flexibility.
