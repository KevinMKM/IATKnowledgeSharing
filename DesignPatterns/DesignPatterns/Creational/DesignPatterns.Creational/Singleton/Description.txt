Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used for resources that should be shared across an application, such as configuration managers, logging services, or database connections.

Key Idea
Restrict a class to a single instance.

Provide a global access point to that instance.

Control the instantiation process to prevent multiple instances.

When to Use the Singleton Pattern
When you need exactly one instance of a class.

For example, a configuration manager or a logging service.

When you want to provide a global access point to an object.

For example, a database connection pool or a thread pool.

When you want to control access to shared resources.

For example, a file manager or a cache.

Example Without Singleton
Imagine you're building a logging service for your application. Without the Singleton pattern, you might create multiple instances of the logger.

Problems with This Approach
Multiple Instances:

Multiple instances of the logger can lead to inconsistent logging (e.g., logs split across different instances).

Resource Waste:

Creating multiple instances of a resource-intensive object (e.g., a database connection) can waste resources.

No Global Access:

There is no single point of access to the logger, making it harder to manage and use.

Key Differences and Benefits
Single Instance:

The Logger class ensures that only one instance exists throughout the application.

Global Access:

The Instance property provides a global access point to the singleton instance.

Consistency:

All logs are stored in a single instance, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplication.

Resource Efficiency:

Only one instance of the logger is created, saving resources.

Summary
Without Singleton: Multiple instances can lead to inconsistency, resource waste, and lack of global access.

With Singleton: Ensures a single instance, provides global access, and improves resource efficiency.

The Singleton pattern is ideal for managing shared resources or services that should have exactly one instance in an application. It is widely used in logging, configuration management, and database connections.
