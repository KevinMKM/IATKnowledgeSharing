Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. While you may already be familiar with classic design patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Observer, there are many other patterns—especially in modern application development—that address specific challenges in distributed systems, microservices, and database interactions. Below is a categorized list of useful design patterns, including the Outbox Pattern , that are particularly relevant for .NET/C# developers working on scalable and maintainable systems.

1. Classic Design Patterns
These are the foundational patterns from the Gang of Four (GoF) book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software."

Creational Patterns
Singleton : Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
Factory Method : Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Abstract Factory : Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Builder : Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
Prototype : Creates new objects by copying an existing object (cloning).
Structural Patterns
Adapter : Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect.
Bridge : Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so the two can vary independently.
Composite : Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Decorator : Adds behavior to objects dynamically without affecting other objects.
Facade : Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
Flyweight : Reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
Proxy : Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access.
Behavioral Patterns
Chain of Responsibility : Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
Command : Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
Interpreter : Implements a specialized language grammar.
Iterator : Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially.
Mediator : Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
Memento : Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
Observer : Defines a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
State : Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
Strategy : Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Template Method : Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
Visitor : Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.
2. Enterprise Integration Patterns
These patterns are commonly used in distributed systems and messaging architectures.

Message Queue : A queue-based messaging system for asynchronous communication.
Publish/Subscribe : A messaging pattern where senders (publishers) send messages to a topic, and receivers (subscribers) subscribe to topics of interest.
Event Sourcing : Stores the state of an application as a sequence of events rather than directly persisting the current state.
Saga Pattern : Manages distributed transactions across multiple services using compensating actions.
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) : Separates read and write operations into different models.
Retry Pattern : Automatically retries failed operations to handle transient errors.
Circuit Breaker : Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service after a threshold is reached.
Outbox Pattern : Ensures reliable event delivery by storing events in the same transaction as business data before publishing them.
3. Database and Persistence Patterns
These patterns address challenges related to database interactions and consistency.

Repository Pattern : Abstracts data access logic and provides a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.
Unit of Work : Maintains a list of objects affected by a business transaction and coordinates writing out changes.
Identity Map : Ensures that each object gets loaded only once by keeping a map of already-loaded objects.
Lazy Loading : Delays the loading of related objects until they are explicitly accessed.
Aggregate Pattern : Groups related objects into a single unit of work, ensuring consistency within the group.
Snapshot Pattern : Captures the state of an object at a specific point in time for auditing or rollback purposes.
4. Microservices Patterns
These patterns are specifically designed for microservices architectures.

API Gateway : Acts as a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices.
Service Discovery : Dynamically locates services in a distributed system.
Sidecar Pattern : Deploys helper components alongside a primary application to offload tasks like logging or monitoring.
Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) : Creates separate backend services tailored to specific frontend applications.
Strangler Fig Pattern : Gradually replaces parts of a monolithic application with microservices.
Anti-Corruption Layer : Protects a domain model from being corrupted by external systems with incompatible models.
5. Concurrency and Parallelism Patterns
These patterns help manage concurrent execution and parallel processing.

Producer-Consumer : Separates the task of producing data from consuming it using a shared buffer.
Thread Pool : Reuses a pool of worker threads to execute tasks efficiently.
Read-Write Lock : Allows multiple readers or a single writer to access a resource.
Future/Promise : Represents the result of an asynchronous computation that will be available in the future.
Actor Model : Encapsulates state and behavior in actors that communicate via message passing.
6. Security Patterns
These patterns address security concerns in software systems.

Token-Based Authentication : Uses tokens (e.g., JWT) for secure authentication and authorization.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) : Grants permissions based on user roles.
Claim-Based Authorization : Grants access based on claims associated with a user.
Secure Storage : Encrypts sensitive data before storing it.
7. Testing Patterns
These patterns improve the quality and maintainability of tests.

Test Double : Includes mocks, stubs, fakes, and spies to isolate the code under test.
Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) : Structures unit tests into three clear phases.
Parameterized Tests : Runs the same test logic with different inputs.
Golden Master Testing : Compares outputs against pre-recorded results to detect regressions.
8. Miscellaneous Patterns
These are additional patterns that don't fit neatly into the above categories.

Feature Toggle : Enables or disables features dynamically without deploying new code.
Pipeline Pattern : Processes data through a series of stages or filters.
Specification Pattern : Encapsulates business rules for querying or validating objects.
Null Object Pattern : Provides a default object to avoid null checks.
Final Thoughts
The patterns listed above are not exhaustive, but they cover a wide range of scenarios in modern software development. The choice of pattern depends on the specific problem you're solving and the architecture of your system. For example:

Use the Outbox Pattern when you need reliable event delivery in a distributed system.
Use CQRS when you want to optimize read and write operations separately.
Use Saga for managing distributed transactions across services.
