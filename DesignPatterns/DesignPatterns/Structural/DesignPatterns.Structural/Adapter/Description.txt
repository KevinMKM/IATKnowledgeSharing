Adapter Design Pattern
The Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

Key Idea
Convert the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.

Allow classes with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Promote reusability of existing classes without modifying their code.

When to Use the Adapter Pattern
When you want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match the one you need.

For example, integrating a third-party library or legacy code.

When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes.

For example, creating a plugin system.

When you want to provide a unified interface to multiple similar classes with different interfaces.

For example, working with different payment gateways.

Example Without Adapter
Imagine you're building a payment system that processes payments using a third-party payment gateway. The third-party gateway has a method ProcessPayment with a different signature than what your system expects.

Problems with This Approach
Incompatible Interfaces:

The PaymentProcessor and ThirdPartyPaymentGateway have different methods and parameters, making them incompatible.

Code Duplication:

If you need to use the third-party gateway in multiple places, you have to manually adapt the interface each time.

Tight Coupling:

The client code is tightly coupled to the specific implementation of the payment gateway.

Key Differences and Benefits
Compatibility:

The adapter allows the ThirdPartyPaymentGateway to work with the IPaymentProcessor interface expected by the client.

Reusability:

The adapter can be reused wherever the third-party gateway needs to be integrated.

Separation of Concerns:

The client code doesn't need to know about the third-party gateway's interface; it only interacts with the IPaymentProcessor interface.

Flexibility:

You can easily switch between different payment processors (e.g., your system's processor or the third-party gateway) without modifying the client code.

Summary
Without Adapter: Incompatible interfaces lead to code duplication, tight coupling, and inflexibility.

With Adapter: The adapter acts as a bridge between incompatible interfaces, promoting reusability, flexibility, and separation of concerns.

The Adapter pattern is ideal for integrating third-party libraries, legacy code, or systems with incompatible interfaces. It is widely used in frameworks, libraries, and systems that need to work with multiple external components.
